During this lab, I learned how to create and manage files using Git.  
I practiced adding, committing, and pushing changes to GitHub.  
I also learned how to use .gitignore and add a license file.  
Creating and merging branches helped me understand version control better.  
Overall, this lab improved my confidence in using Git and GitHub.
